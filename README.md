## Description

The application also enables for the updating of certain content like thoughts and a user's profile. Users can also be deleted.

This application runs in the terminal so users will have to download the repository. It also requires users to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

Users will have to have MongoDB installed on their machine. They can do so by following the instructions [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Users will also have to install Mongooose by running the following command in the terminal: `npm install mongoose`.

Credit to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for their [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for their [documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html) which made it far easier to understand the differences between this and MySQL.

Credit to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for generating the initial data I used for my database like thoughts, usernames, emails, and the like.
